# Credit-Scoring
This is a training project aimed at exploring different machine learning methods for solving credit scoring problems. - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cmf-2022-bank-scoring-case/overview

## Introduction
The task of credit scoring is one of the most popular areas where machine learning algorithms are applied. The scoring program is developed by risk managers of the bank based on a large amount of data on repayment/non-repayment of individual loans.
High-quality scoring model allows to make decision-making on a flow, to reduce disbursement terms and to simplify collection of necessary documents. For the bank's client the use of scoring reduces the cost of granting and the loan itself, significantly reduces the list of documents required by the bank and the terms of granting.

## Historical data
In this problem you are given historical data: a set of 10 attributes on loan applications. For each application you know if the loan was overdue (target=1) or if it was repaid on time (target=0).

## Solution
The process of solving that problem is presented in the notebook "Final.ipynb"

## Presentation
My team and I created a special presentation "scoring cmf.pptx", combining our best decisions, analytics and visualization of the data and suitable machine learning algorythms and their  evaluations.
